# JSON-LD Context Docs

JSON-LD contexts for OWL/RDF ontologies used by the EDR. These are local documents
referring to community models. Should the maintainers of those models publish
canonical contexts these will be replaced by those.

The only exception is where it is useful to define a subset of of a larger
context to guide local applications (e.g. distilling schema.org).

Contexts are versioned according to their source ontology's versions - e.g. the
W3C YYYY-MM approach for SKOS and RDFS.
