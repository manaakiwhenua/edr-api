# NSDR-LD JSON Schema Docs

Common schema used by all JSON:API compliant responses. Will be extended by JSON
schema autogenerated from application specific sources (e.g. NSDR Constraint Sets).

Includes legacy schema from version 3 of the NSDR API (given the version number 0.3).
NSDR API v1 and v2 can be considered version 0.1 and 0.2 of this API. These used the same schema.
